# UnreliableSerialization (Event 7)

Used to send data that does not require reliability (e.g. can be interpolated) over the network.

Such data includes:
 - Player Network data (Ping (& variance), delta time,  Packet Quality (loss?))
 - Camera Physics (Position, Rotation, Flags)
 - Player Physics (Position, Rotation, Flags)
 - Muscles

This documentation is very sensitive and is kept under strict control, only a few select people will have access to this.
